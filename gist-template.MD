## Summary

## What is a Regex? 
A regex, short for "regular expression," is a sequence of characters that define a particular search pattern. Primarily used for pattern matching within strings, regex is an important tool that allows users to efficiently search, validate, parse, and replace certain patterns of characters within a string spanning over large bodies of text. 

In this tutorial, we will be breaking down the components of a Regular Expression used to search for a specific hex value, or hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal is a color coding system that labels colors with a hashtag followed by 6 numbers that are unique to that color (ex: #000000). Below is the regex that I will be explaining in this tutorial.  

Regex Expression: /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
